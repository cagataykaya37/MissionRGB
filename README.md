3RD ALL-BY-MYSELF GAME DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (1ST 3D ONE)


+ Levels are simple and good
+ Effect of explode was really nice
+ Upload section is working well but problems in saving that data
+ Reload and ammo counter system works well


Problems:
- Save system not working; each time scene loads data resets
- "Next level" is not working, when level 8 is done, next level buton must direct to level 9
- Controls and UI wasn't optimized for mobile
- When enemies die, they still shoot a bullet
- Ceiling cover of rooms was a pratic idea but not worked well
